      <p>Thanks for checking out my website!</p>
      <p>
        This is my first full stack application. That means I had to build both
        the website you are looking at, (aka the "front-end") as well as the
        server and database (aka "back-end") it needs to communicate with to
        create, read, update, and delete the data that is displayed on the
        front-end as you use the app.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of the functionality of this app was built during a week-long
        sprint for my second General Assembly coding project. I then spent
        another week polishing the appearance in my spare time, resulting in the
        website you are now using. I plan to continue updating the site and will
        eventually include it as part of my portfolio. I hope you find it
        useful, or at least interesting to look at!
