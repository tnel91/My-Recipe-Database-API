      name: 'Marcella Hazan’s Bolognese Sauce',

      yield: '6 servings',
      totalTime: '',
      ingredients:
        '1 tablespoon vegetable oil\n3 tablespoons butter plus 1 tablespoon for tossing the pasta\n½ cup chopped onion\n⅔ cup chopped celery\n⅔ cup chopped carrot\n¾ pound ground beef chuck (or you can use 1 part pork to 2 parts beef)\nSalt\nBlack pepper, ground fresh from the mill\n1 cup whole milk\nWhole nutmeg\n1 cup dry white wine\n1½ cups canned imported Italian plum tomatoes, cut up, with their juice\n1¼ to 1½ pounds pasta\nFreshly grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese at the table',
      instructions:
        'Step 1 Put the oil, butter and chopped onion in the pot and turn the heat on to medium. Cook and stir the onion until it has become translucent, then add the chopped celery and carrot. Cook for about 2 minutes, stirring vegetables to coat them well.\nStep 2 Add ground beef, a large pinch of salt and a few grindings of pepper. Crumble the meat with a fork, stir well and cook until the beef has lost its raw, red color.\nStep 3 Add milk and let it simmer gently, stirring frequently, until it has bubbled away completely. Add a tiny grating -- about ⅛ teaspoon -- of nutmeg, and stir.\nStep 4 Add the wine, let it simmer until it has evaporated, then add the tomatoes and stir thoroughly to coat all ingredients well. When the tomatoes begin to bubble, turn the heat down so that the sauce cooks at the laziest of simmers, with just an intermittent bubble breaking through to the surface. Cook, uncovered, for 3 hours or more, stirring from time to time. While the sauce is cooking, you are likely to find that it begins to dry out and the fat separates from the meat. To keep it from sticking, add ½ cup of water whenever necessary. At the end, however, no water at all must be left and the fat must separate from the sauce. Taste and correct for salt.\nStep 5 Toss with cooked drained pasta, adding the tablespoon of butter, and serve with freshly grated Parmesan on the side.',

      description:
        'This recipe appeared on the back of our King Arthur flour bags for years. Many a baker has learned to bake crusty, chewy hearth-style bread using this recipe — how about you? With its directions geared towards the beginning bread baker, this is a wonderful place for a "newbie" to start. Bonus: The recipe makes two big loaves, one to enjoy at home and one to share with a neighbor or friend.',
      yield: '2 loaves',
      totalTime: '2 hrs 35 mins',
      ingredients:
        '1 (1/4-ounce) packet active dry yeast or 2 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast\n      1 tablespoon (14g) granulated sugar\n      1 tablespoon (18g) salt\n      2 cups (454g) lukewarm water (not over 110°F)\n      5 1/2 to 6 cups (660g to 720g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour\n      cornmeal or semolina for sprinkling on the pan, optional',
      instructions:
        "To mix the dough: Mix all of the ingredients together, using the smaller amount of flour. Mix thoroughly until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl, adding more of the flour if necessary. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface to knead. (This may be a little messy, but don't give up!)\n      To knead the dough by hand: Fold the far edge of the dough back over on itself towards you. Press into the dough with the heels of your hands and push away. After each push, rotate the dough 90°. Repeat this process in a rhythmic, rocking motion for 5 minutes, sprinkling only enough flour on your kneading surface to prevent sticking. Let the dough rest while you scrape out and grease the mixing bowl. Knead the dough again for 2 to 3 minutes.\n      To knead the dough using a stand mixer: Mix all of the ingredients together using your mixer's dough hook. You'll want to reduce the amount of water to 1 3/4 cups, since you won't be using any extra flour on a kneading surface, as you do when kneading by hand. Knead the dough at low-medium speed for about 10 minutes total, until it's smooth and just barely sticking to the bottom and/or sides of the bowl.\n      Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl large enough for it to at least double in size. Cover with plastic wrap and place in a warm, draft-free place (your turned-off oven works well) until the dough doubles, about 1 to 2 hours.\n      To shape the dough: Gently deflate the dough. Cut it in half and shape into two oval Italian- or longer, thinner French-style loaves. Place the loaves on a baking sheet lined with parchment (if you have it) and generously sprinkled with cornmeal or semolina. The cornmeal or semolina are optional, but give the bottom crust lovely crunch. \n      Let the loaves rise, gently covered in greased plastic wrap, for 45 minutes, until they're noticeably puffy. Toward the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 425°F.\n      To bake the bread: Brush or spray the loaves generously with lukewarm water; this step, which helps keep the top crust pliant while baking, will enhance the bread's rise. Lightly slash the tops of the loaves three or more times diagonally. Place the pan on the middle rack of the oven.\n      Bake the bread for 35 to 40 minutes, until the crust is golden brown and sounds hollow to the touch. The interior temperature of the bread should register at least 200°F on a digital thermometer.\n      Remove the loaves from the oven, take them off the pan, and return them to the oven, placing them right on the rack. Turn the oven off and crack the door open several inches. Let the loaves cool in the cooling oven; this will make them extra-crusty.\n      Store completely cool bread in a paper bag at room temperature for a couple of days. For longer storage, wrap well and freeze.",

      notes:
        'Can you mix and knead this dough using a bread machine? Yes, of course. Place all of the ingredients into the bucket of your machine, set it to the dough cycle, and let the machine complete its cycle. Shape, let rise, and bake bread as directed in the recipe above.\n      As a result of reader feedback, we\'ve omitted the instructions from the original recipe for baking the bread by starting it in a cold oven. Not all ovens preheat the same way, and baking in a preheating oven may cause bread to burn. For those of you who\'ve been making this recipe successfully starting in a cold oven, here are the directions you\'d been using, starting with slashing the risen loaves: "Lightly slash the tops of the loaves three or more times diagonally and brush them with cold water. Place the pan on the middle rack of a cold oven with a roasting filled about 1" deep with boiling water on the oven bottom. Set the oven temperature to 450°F, and turn on the oven. Bake the bread for 35 to 45 minutes, until the crust is golden brown and sounds hollow to the touch. Its interior temperature should register at least 190°F on a digital thermometer."'

      instructions:
        'In a small bowl, whisk together your cornstarch slurry ingredients together and set aside.\n      In a large mixing bowl add your diced chicken thighs followed by cornstarch and mix until each piece is coated in cornstarch. Tip: Ensure your chicken thighs are a bit wet or moist so the cornstarch can stick. If they’re dry for any reason, rinse the thighs under cold water and strain before dicing.\n      Then in a large pan or wok set over medium high heat, add your avocado oil. Once the oil is hot and glistening, carefully lower your coated chicken and fry until golden, crispy brown. About 10 minutes depending on how high your heat is. You may need to adjust your heat.\n      Remove the fried chicken and transfer to a plate. Increase the heat to high. With the residual oil in the pan, add onion and fry for 1 minutes until aromatic.\n      Next add your remaining sauce ingredients, leaving the soy sauce last to add. Mix well breaking apart the gochujang. Finally add the cornstarch slurry and mix. Reduce and simmer the sauce until thick and glossy.\n      Finally add your fried chicken back in and cover in the sauce. Once all the chicken is covered in the sauce, remove and transfer to a serving plate. Garnish with sesame seeds and green onions (optional). Enjoy!',

        "Ditch the canned soup and bake a chicken and rice casserole from scratch with mushrooms, garlic, cream, and herbs. It’s a family recipe that's special enough to make for company.",
      yield: '6 servings',
      totalTime: '95 mins',
      ingredients:
        '2 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1 into 1 1/2 inch pieces, patted dry\nSalt and freshly ground pepper\n4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided\n1 medium onion, chopped\n2 cloves garlic, minced\n8 ounces cremini or button mushrooms, sliced\n1/4 cup dry sherry or white wine\n1 1/3 cups chicken stock (see Recipe Note)\n1/2 cup sour cream\n1/4 cup heavy cream\n1 cup uncooked white rice, medium or long grain\n1 1/2 teaspoons salt\n1 teaspoon Italian seasoning\n1 teaspoon poultry seasoning\n1/2 teaspoon paprika\n2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley',
      instructions:
        "Preheat the oven:\nPreheat the oven to 375°F.\n\nBrown the chicken:\nHeat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large sauté pan on medium high or high heat (hot enough to brown but not burn). Season the chicken pieces all over with salt and pepper.\n\nWorking in batches, brown the chicken pieces on both sides, about 1 to 2 minutes per batch. Add a little more olive oil if needed with every batch.\n\nRemove chicken pieces and set aside in a bowl. The chicken does not have to be cooked through, only browned.\n\nBrowning Chicken Pieces for Cream of Mushroom Chicken and Rice Casserole\nSauté the onions and garlic:\nIn the same sauté pan add 1 tablespoon olive oil. Lower the heat to medium, add the onions, and cook until translucent, about 3 minutes.\n\nAdd the garlic; cook 30 seconds more. Remove onions and garlic to a shallow 9x13-inch casserole dish.\n\nChicken Rice Casserole Browning Onions in the skillet\nSauté the mushrooms:\nRaise heat to medium high and add the sliced mushrooms. Dry sauté the mushrooms (don't add butter or oil), allowing them to brown lightly and release some of their moisture. Add the mushrooms to the casserole dish.\n\nSautéing Mushrooms in skillet for Chicken and Rice Casserole\nMake the sauce:\nAdd 1/4 cup dry sherry or dry white wine to the pan to deglaze it, scraping off the browned bits from the bottom.\n\n(At this point, if you are making ahead, reduce the sherry to 1 tablespoon and pour off into the casserole dish. Refrigerate cooked onions, garlic, mushrooms, and browned chicken pieces until you are ready to make the casserole.)\n\nLet the sherry reduce to about 1 tablespoon, then add the chicken stock, and remove from heat. Stir in 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, the cream, and the sour cream.\n\nBest Chicken and Rice Casserole Reduce the Sherry in pan\nAssemble the casserole:\nAdd the uncooked rice to the casserole dish. Then pour the stock, sherry, cream, and sour cream mixture over the rice.\n\nAdd the Italian and poultry seasonings (or fresh herbs) and paprika to the dish.\n\nStir the rice, onion, mushroom, and herb mixture so that they are evenly distributed in the casserole dish.\n\nPlace the chicken pieces on top of the rice mixture (in a single layer if you can, they will be crowded).\n\nSIMPLE TIP!\nYou can add 1 cup of frozen, unthawed peas in with the rice when you assemble the casserole. Because of the wine, the peas won't stay bright green, but they are still tasty.\n\nMixing ingredients for chicken and rice casserole\nChicken pieces on top of a chicken and rice casserole, ready to bake\nBake:\nCover the casserole dish tightly with aluminum foil. Bake in a 375°F oven for 45 minutes and then remove foil.\n\nIf the casserole still has too much liquid, let it cook a few minutes more, uncovered, until the excess liquid has evaporated away.\n\nServe:\nSprinkle with fresh parsley before serving.",

        'This recipe assumes the rice requires about 1 1/2 cups of liquid per cup of rice to cook. Some rice varieties, such as brown rice, require more liquid (and a longer cooking time). Adjust recipe accordingly.\nIf you are avoiding cooking with alcohol, skip the sherry and deglaze the pan with a 1/4 cup extra of chicken stock.\n\nDepending on how salted your stock is, you may need to more generously salt this dish. You can always salt to taste at the table.'
